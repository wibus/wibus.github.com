%% PROJECTS

\cvsection{PROJECTS}

\cventry{2015~--~2016}{Short animated film}{Personal project}{
    \textit{The Fruit -- A Moving Picture}~: \href{http://wibus.github.io/ExTh}{wibus.github.io/ExTh}\\
    Animation, rendering and post-production software design exclusively for this animation\\
    The system renders the images using a progressive multithreaded and distributed path tracer\\
    The post-production software reduces the noise by sampling temporally, creates bloom effects, apply local tone-mapping  and corrects the gamma of the images\\
    The scene contains zero triangles; every object is the result of boolean operations on quadrics (planes, spheres, paraboloids, hyperboloids)
}

\cventry{2011~--~2016}{Simulation engine}{Personal project}{
    \textit{Experiemental Theatre} is a  C++ library regrouping the four following modules:\\
    $\bullet$ \textit{Cellar Workbech}~: Data structures, generic design patterns, logging, geometric primitives, resources management,  OpenGL wrapper classes, string utility functions, etc.\\
    $\bullet$ \textit{Prop Room 2D}~: 2D rendering and Newtonian mechanic framework\\
    $\bullet$ \textit{Prop Room 3D}~: Multithreaded and distributed path tracing framework\\
    $\bullet$ \textit{Scaena}~: Game and simulation entity management framework\\
    At least ten personal projects are based on this library, including my master's research project\\
    Open source Github repository: \href{http://www.github.com/wibus/ExperimentalTheatre}{github.com/wibus/ExperimentalTheatre}
}

\cventry{Spring\\2015}{Kinect Game for Laval Virtual}{Academic project}{
    Kinect 2 obstacle course with Android companion app\\
    Allies help the runner by dropping collectibles on his path\\
    Enemies slow down or stop the runner by dropping bombs and obstacles on his path\\
    Companion apps are connected to the main computer by WiFi on a LAN\\
    The path is procedurally generated for a unique experience on each run\\
    The game is physically demanding for the runner and promote cooperation among companions
