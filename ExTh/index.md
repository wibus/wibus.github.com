# Experimental Theatre

## Introduction

* Software as an artwork
* I'm not a 3D artist. I'm an hard coder.
* Tools (library/animator/compositor)
* Product (short animation video)


## ExTh: A Software Library


## The Fruit : A Moving Picture


## What have been done


Summary a development :

* December 2010 : c++ experimentations, putting reusable code in a library
* Febrary 2013 : refactoring library into multiple layers : CellarWorkbench, PropRoom2D, PropRoom3D and Sceana.
* January 2015 : begining of the analytic surface path tracer
* July 2016 : final render of 'The Fruit' short film

## What could (or should) have been done


## What's next for Experiemental Theatre's path tracer

It's going to garbarge. I've learn a lot of lessons doing this project, and those wont fallow to the trash, but I'll take advantage of them only in the case I work on a production path tracer. I mean, if ever I find my way to work on RenderMan, Maxwell Renderer, Arnold, etc., etc... this experience will prove useful. So, the path tracer won't benefit from any further improvement. No triangle mesh support, no multiple importance sampling fix and no soft coded animation editor. To be honest, I'm a bit tired right now. Taking a step back, this year an a half of intense development for a tiny 1m35s of animation seems a bit crazy. I guess that a talented 3D artist could have produced a better animation in a single week (2 days of creation, 5 days of rendering :P) with proper softwares. That's why its going to garbage. That's why I'm now turning myself to mature path tracers.
