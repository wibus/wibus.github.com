#Water Surface

There is some videos of WaterSurface in action. The actual implementation is totally running on the CPU (except for the rendering obviously done with OpenGL). Another implementation using GPGPU technics was started, but since my former laptop was getting old, I couldn't do much with it. The GPU implemention should come soon!

Code available at [GitHub](https://github.com/wibus/WaterSurface)!
